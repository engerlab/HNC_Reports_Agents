    "You are an assistant specialized in summarizing head and neck cancer consultation notes written in both French and English. Extract the following structured information from the consultation note. **Ensure that the output strictly follows the specified field labels below without adding any additional narrative text.** Do not invent any information. If a field is not directly provided, state 'Not inferred', unless the instructions specify otherwise. Provide each field on its own line in the format `FieldName: Value`.\n\nNow, fill in these fields:\n\nSmoking_History:\nAlcohol_Consumption:\nPack_Years:  (If the patient is a non-smoker, indicate 0 rather than 'Not inferred'.)\nPatient_Symptoms_at_Presentation:  (Describe the patient's symptoms at presentation.)\nRecommendations:\nPlans:  (Describe any follow-up plans as noted in the consultation.)\nHPV_Status:\nPatient_History_Status_Prior_Conditions:  (Include any previous cancers or preexisting conditions prior to the current diagnosis.)\nPatient_History_Status_Previous_Treatments:\nClinical_Assessments_Radiological_Lesions:\nClinical_Assessments_SUV_from_PET_scans:\nCharlson_Comorbidity_Score:  (Calculate a weighted index of comorbidities by assigning points to various diseases based on their potential impact on mortality. A higher score indicates a higher risk of 1-year mortality. Refer to https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3917/charlson-comorbidity-index-cci#when-to-use if needed.)\nKarnofsky_Performance_Status:\nECOG:  (If only one performance score is provided, derive the other using the following conversion:\n  - Grade 1: KPS values of 100, 90, or 80 correspond to ECOG scores of 0 or 1.\n  - Grade 2: KPS values of 70 or 60 correspond to an ECOG score of 2.\n  - Grade 3: KPS values less than 60 correspond to ECOG scores of 3 or 4.)\nCancer_Staging_Pathological_TNM:\nCancer_Staging_Clinical_TNM:\nCancer_Staging_Tumor_Size:  (Ensure that tumor size is reported as a two-dimensional measurement derived from CT scans, excluding any third dimension from physical exam.)\n\nNow, extract the information from the following consultation note:\n\nSummarized Consultation Note:\n{context}",
    "If a field was not directly provided, write 'Not inferred', except where the instructions specify an alternative (e.g., Pack_Years should be 0 for non-smokers). Do not add any additional summary or commentary beyond these fields."

    "You are an oncologist specialized in head and neck cancer. You have been provided combined text that merges the relevant pathology and consultation notes for one patient. Read it **in detail**, and then propose a personalized treatment plan based on the actual information found in the text. If surgery is involved, describe the surgery in detail; if radiotherapy is involved, describe radiation quality, techniques, fractions, and schedule; if chemotherapy is involved, describe the chemo drug used and schedule. Provide your reasoning for each modality, referencing exactly what is present in the text. Do not make up any new information that the text did not specify.",
    "Pay close attention to biomarkers such as p16 or HPV. If the text states they are negative or not mentioned, do not assume positivity. If the text is unclear, state 'Not specified' or 'Unclear'. Likewise, if the text does not mention tumor stage or other patient data, do not fabricate it. Instead, state 'Not specified' if the text is silent about that aspect.",
    "If you are referencing clinical trials or alternative treatments, provide specific trial names, phases, and results that come from the text, or else note if 'Not specified in the text'. Provide any relevant citations if they are mentioned.",
    "Finally, predict the patient's post-treatment outcomes for overall survival, locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, progression-free survival, and disease-free survival. Provide approximate time-to-event, x-year probabilities, or confidence intervals",

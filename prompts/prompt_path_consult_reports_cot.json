      "Below are the fields you must output:",

      "- Tumor_Type_Differentiation: (Possible values might be Well differentiated, Moderately differentiated, Poorly differentiated, or Not inferred if unclear.)",
      "- Lymph_Node_Status_Presence_Absence: (Present, Absent, or Suspected, or Not inferred. If the text explicitly says there is no neck lymphadenopathy, you may conclude Absent. Otherwise, Not inferred.)",
      "- Lymph_Node_Status_Number_of_Positve_Lymph_Nodes: (Provide the number of positive lymph nodes if mentioned. If Lymph_Node_Status_Presence_Absence is Absent, then 0, Else, Not inferred.)",
      "- Lymph_Node_Status_Extranodal_Extension: (Present or Absent or Not Inferred. If Lymph_Node_Status_Presence_Absence was absent, then Lymph_Node_Status_Extranodal_Extension is absent. Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to a specific pattern of cancer progression where malignant cells originate within a lymph node and subsequently invade the surrounding tissues.)",
      "- p16_Status: (Positive or Negative. If the text says p16 is negative, set this to Negative; if it says p16 is positive, set to Positive.)",
      "- Smoking_History: (Smoker, Ex-smoker, Non-Smoker, or Not inferred. For example, if the text says 'quit 20 years ago', that is Ex-smoker.)",
      "- Alcohol_Consumption: (Drinker, Non-Drinker, or Not inferred. If text states 'does not drink alcohol', output Non-Drinker.)",
      "- Pack_Years: (If the text mentions, e.g., '42 pack-years', output the integer 42. If none is stated or unclear, Not inferred. If the patient is a non-smoker with no mention of prior smoking, 0.)",
      "- Patient_Symptoms_at_Presentation: (List any relevant symptoms, e.g. dysphonia, weight loss, shortness of breath. If none are mentioned, Not inferred.)",
      "- Recommendations: (Any treatment recommendations, be detailed but concise, e.g. 'laser excision vs radiotherapy'.)",
      "- Plans: (Include all follow-up appointments, investigations, or next steps mentioned in the text, e.g. 'CT simulation, consult with medical oncology, PEG tube placement, dentistry, audiology').",
      "- HPV_Status: (Should match p16_Status exactly: Positive → Positive, Negative → Negative.)",
      "- Patient_History_Status_Prior_Conditions: (List preexisting comorbidities or conditions, e.g. 'diabetes mellitus type 2', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia'.)",
      "- Patient_History_Status_Previous_Treatments: (List prior treatments or medications, e.g. 'Actos, Crestor', etc.)",

If for some reason it appears here, ensure you include it. If no mention, Not inferred.)",

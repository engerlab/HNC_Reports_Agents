    "- Tumor_Type_Differentiation: (Well differentiated, Moderately differentiated, Poorly differentiated.)",

    "- Smoking_History: (Smoker, Ex-smoker, Non-Smoker. For example, if the text says 'quit nine years ago', that is Ex-smoker.)",
    "- Alcohol_Consumption: (Drinker, Non-Drinker. If text states 'does not drink alcohol', output Non-Drinker.)",
    "- Pack_Years: (If the text mentions, e.g., '36 pack-years', output the integer 36. If the patient is a non-smoker with no mention of prior smoking, 0.)",
    "- Patient_Symptoms_at_Presentation: (List any symptoms the patient is currently having or complaining, e.g. dysphonia, weight loss, shortness of breath.)",
    "- Treatment_Recommendations: (Indiate any treatment recommendations, e.g. 'laser excision vs radiotherapy', 'chemo-radiotherapy'.)",
    "- Follow_Up_Plans: (Indicate any follow-up or next-step plans, such as who the patient will be seen or do next, e.g. 'patient leaning toward laser excision'.)",
    "- HPV_Status: (Positive or Negative. Should be exactly the same as p16_Status: if p16_Status is Positive, then HPV_Status is Positive, if p16_Status is Negative, then HPV_Status is Negative.)",
    "- Patient_History_Status_Prior_Conditions: (List preexisting comorbidities or conditions, e.g. 'diabetes mellitus type 2', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia'.)",
    "- Patient_History_Status_Previous_Treatments: (List medical histories, previous treatments and medications, e.g. 'Actos, Crestor', etc.)",
    "- Charlson_Comorbidity_Score: (Provide a numeric value. Then, in brackets, explain how you arrived at it. If no comorbidities are present, 0. If uncertain, explain your reasoning.)",
    "- Karnofsky_Performance_Status: (Provide a numeric value, 0–100, plus reasoning in brackets. If you only find an ECOG value, convert using the table below.)",
    "- ECOG_Performance_Status: (Numeric 0–5, plus reasoning in brackets. If you only find KPS, convert.)",

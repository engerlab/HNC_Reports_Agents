Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to a specific pattern of cancer progression where malignant cells originate within a lymph node and subsequently invade the surrounding tissues. If suspected or Not Inferred, provide numerical value followed by reason in bracekt. (e.g. Suspected, tumor cells at the modal capsule with possible invasion into perinodal fat. Suspicious of cancer cells spreading from a lymph node into adjacent muscle tissue) Else, Not inferred.)",

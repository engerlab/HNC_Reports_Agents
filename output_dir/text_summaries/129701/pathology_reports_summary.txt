Here's a summary of the report:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a mass in his right tongue base that has spread to the left side, measuring approximately 3 cm. The initial impression was carcinoma (cancer) and possible lymphoma. 

During an intraoperative consultation (while surgery was being performed), a frozen section analysis of the tissue from the right tongue base revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Further examination of the tissue fragments confirmed the diagnosis of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in the submucosa of the right tongue base. 

Additionally, a subsequent test for p16 (a protein associated with human papillomavirus) was conducted and came back positive. This suggests that the cancer may be related to HPV infection.

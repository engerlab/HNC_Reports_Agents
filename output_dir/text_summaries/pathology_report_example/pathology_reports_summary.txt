Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:**
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity. A biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.

**Diagnosis:**
The diagnosis is an invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa (the layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane).

**Additional Findings:**

* Perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves) was not identified.
* Lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading to blood or lymph vessels) is suspicious, but not confirmed.
* The tumor tested negative for p16 and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), which can be associated with certain types of cancer.
* The overlaying squamous epithelium (the layer of skin-like cells on top of the tumor) is uninvolved, meaning it does not show signs of cancer.

**Immunohistochemical Profile:**
The tumor cells tested positive for certain proteins (AE1/AE3, CK5/6, CK8/18, p63) and negative for others (CK20, CD31, D2-40), which can help identify the type of cancer.

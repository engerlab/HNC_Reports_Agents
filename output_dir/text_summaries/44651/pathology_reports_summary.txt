This is a final pathology report for an 88-year-old woman with left alveolar cancer. Here's a summary of the key findings:

**Clinical History:**
The patient has left alveolar cancer, and the report includes the examination of multiple specimens from different locations in the mouth and neck.

**Specimen #1-6 (Frozen Sections):**
These specimens were taken during surgery to check for cancer cells at the margins of the tumor. All six specimens showed no evidence of neoplasia (cancer) at the margins.

**Specimen #7 (Left Superior Alveolar Mass):**
This specimen was a partial maxillectomy (removal of part of the upper jawbone) and included a tumor in the upper gingiva/alveolus. The tumor was:

* 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm in size
* Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
* Involved the tooth socket with superficial bone invasion
* Had involved margins, both peripheral and deep

**Specimen #8 (Left Neck Dissection):**
This specimen included 31 lymph nodes from levels I, II, and III of the neck. None of the lymph nodes showed evidence of cancer.

**Specimen #9 (Left Node of Stahr):**
This was a single lymph node that was examined, and it did not show any evidence of cancer.

**Pathologic Staging:**
The tumor was classified as pT2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension), and there was no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left alveolar ridge with involved margins, but no evidence of lymph node metastasis.

**Diagnosis**

* Maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) that is poorly differentiated and non-keratinizing.
* The tumor is locally advanced, measuring 4.5 x 3.5 cm, with positive margins and lymphovascular invasion.

**Treatment**

* Underwent a right maxillectomy (surgical removal of the maxilla bone) with palatectomy and a fibular free flap on [DATE].
* Pathology report showed cancer in one lymph node, but no extracapsular extension.
* Adjuvant radiation therapy is recommended to the surgical bed, ipsilateral neck, and contralateral level 2, combined with weekly chemotherapy as a radiosensitizer.

Here is a summary of the pathology report:

An 85-year-old man had a biopsy taken from an ulcer on the midline of his soft palate due to suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA). The final diagnosis is:

* Invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
* The tumor's thickness could not be measured due to the fragmented nature of the specimen
* p16 immunostaining was negative (this test can help determine if the cancer is related to human papillomavirus)
* No infectious organisms were found on special stains

The report was reviewed and agreed upon by an internal consultant. The biopsy consisted of two small tissue fragments, which were submitted for examination in a single container.

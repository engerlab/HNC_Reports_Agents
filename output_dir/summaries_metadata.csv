62806.txt,consultation_notes,"Here's a summary of the report:

**Patient Profile:**

* A lady with a history of hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia, taking Synthroid and Lipitor, and allergic to iodine contrast.
* Non-smoker and non-drinker.

**Current Illness:**

* Diagnosed with a left buccal mucosa minor salivary gland tumor, which was initially thought to be a pleomorphic adenoma but later revealed to be a low-grade salivary gland adenocarcinoma after excisional resection.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

* Post-operative MRI to investigate any residual disease.
* Depending on the MRI results, either adjuvant external beam radiotherapy or surgical re-resection may be considered."
44651.txt,pathology_reports,"This is a final pathology report for an 88-year-old woman with left alveolar cancer. Here's a summary of the key findings:

**Clinical History:**
The patient has left alveolar cancer, and the report includes the examination of multiple specimens from different locations in the mouth and neck.

**Specimen #1-6 (Frozen Sections):**
These specimens were taken during surgery to check for cancer cells at the margins of the tumor. All six specimens showed no evidence of neoplasia (cancer) at the margins.

**Specimen #7 (Left Superior Alveolar Mass):**
This specimen was a partial maxillectomy (removal of part of the upper jawbone) and included a tumor in the upper gingiva/alveolus. The tumor was:

* 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm in size
* Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
* Involved the tooth socket with superficial bone invasion
* Had involved margins, both peripheral and deep

**Specimen #8 (Left Neck Dissection):**
This specimen included 31 lymph nodes from levels I, II, and III of the neck. None of the lymph nodes showed evidence of cancer.

**Specimen #9 (Left Node of Stahr):**
This was a single lymph node that was examined, and it did not show any evidence of cancer.

**Pathologic Staging:**
The tumor was classified as pT2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension), and there was no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the left alveolar ridge with involved margins, but no evidence of lymph node metastasis."
pathology_report_example.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:**
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity. A biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.

**Diagnosis:**
The diagnosis is an invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa (the layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane).

**Additional Findings:**

* Perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves) was not identified.
* Lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading to blood or lymph vessels) is suspicious, but not confirmed.
* The tumor tested negative for p16 and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), which can be associated with certain types of cancer.
* The overlaying squamous epithelium (the layer of skin-like cells on top of the tumor) is uninvolved, meaning it does not show signs of cancer.

**Immunohistochemical Profile:**
The tumor cells tested positive for certain proteins (AE1/AE3, CK5/6, CK8/18, p63) and negative for others (CK20, CD31, D2-40), which can help identify the type of cancer."
236853.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient:** A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity.

**Biopsy Results:**

* The biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.
* The diagnosis is an invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa.
* There is no perineural invasion (cancer spread to nerves), but lymphovascular invasion (cancer spread to blood or lymph vessels) is suspicious.
* Additional tests:
	+ p16 immunohistochemistry: negative
	+ EBV probe (EBER): negative

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* The tumor has focal intercellular bridges and the overlaying squamous epithelium is not involved.
* The tumor cells have a specific immunohistochemical profile, which includes positivity for certain markers (AE1/AE3, CK5/6, CK8/18, CK7, p63) and negativity for others (CK20, CD31, D2-40).

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a high-grade squamous cell carcinoma in his right alveolar ridge, with suspicious lymphovascular invasion. The results will likely guide further treatment decisions, including surgery scheduled for 10 days from the report date."
1244601.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Clinical History:** The patient had a biopsy of their left tonsil and a fine-needle aspiration (FNAB) of a mass in their left neck.

**Diagnosis:**

* **Left Tonsil Biopsy:** Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) was found. The tumor tested positive for P16, which is a marker that can help identify certain types of cancer.
* **Left Neck FNAB:** Unfortunately, only blood was obtained from the aspiration, and no diagnostic tissue or cells were found.

**Macroscopic Description:**

* **Tonsil Biopsy:** The biopsy sample consisted of a small, fragile piece of tissue (1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm) that was sectioned and submitted for further examination.
* **Neck FNAB:** Only a small amount of black sediment (likely blood) was obtained from the aspiration.

In summary, the report confirms the presence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the left tonsil, but the FNAB of the neck mass did not yield any diagnostic tissue or cells."
129701.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the report:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a mass in his right tongue base that has spread to the left side, measuring approximately 3 cm. The initial impression was carcinoma (cancer) and possible lymphoma. 

During an intraoperative consultation (while surgery was being performed), a frozen section analysis of the tissue from the right tongue base revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Further examination of the tissue fragments confirmed the diagnosis of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in the submucosa of the right tongue base. 

Additionally, a subsequent test for p16 (a protein associated with human papillomavirus) was conducted and came back positive. This suggests that the cancer may be related to HPV infection."
166906.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the pathology report:

An 85-year-old man had a biopsy taken from an ulcer on the midline of his soft palate due to suspicion of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA). The final diagnosis is:

* Invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
* The tumor's thickness could not be measured due to the fragmented nature of the specimen
* p16 immunostaining was negative (this test can help determine if the cancer is related to human papillomavirus)
* No infectious organisms were found on special stains

The report was reviewed and agreed upon by an internal consultant. The biopsy consisted of two small tissue fragments, which were submitted for examination in a single container."

Here's a summary of the report:

**Patient Profile:**

* A lady with a history of hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia, taking Synthroid and Lipitor, and allergic to iodine contrast.
* Non-smoker and non-drinker.

**Current Illness:**

* Diagnosed with a left buccal mucosa minor salivary gland tumor, which was initially thought to be a pleomorphic adenoma but later revealed to be a low-grade salivary gland adenocarcinoma after excisional resection.
* The tumor was removed in fragments, and pathology showed lymphovascular invasion but no perineural invasion.

**Previous Investigations:**

* MRI of the head and neck region before surgery showed a 1.4 x 1.6-cm enhancing lesion in the left buccal space, close to the maxillary alveolar bone, with no bony invasion.
* Abnormal enhancement was seen along the course of the fifth nerve (V3) of unknown etiology.

**Current Status:**

* The patient has recovered well from surgery and has no complaints, but reports a 20-pound weight loss of unknown etiology.
* Physical examination shows a residual 1-cm mass on the upper aspect of the left buccal mucosa, which is suspicious of residual disease.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

* Post-operative MRI to investigate any residual disease.
* Depending on the MRI results, either adjuvant external beam radiotherapy or surgical re-resection may be considered.

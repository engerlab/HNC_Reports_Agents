Charlson_Comorbidity_Score: 2 [1 point for basal cell carcinoma (considered a form of skin cancer, but not directly listed; using the closest relevant condition), and considering the patient's history does not explicitly mention other significant comorbidities that would add points]
Karnofsky_Performance_Status: 90 [ECOG status is 1, which generally corresponds to a Karnofsky performance status of around 80-100, with 1 being able to perform all normal activities with only slight limitations; hence, choosing a value towards the higher end but not perfect due to symptoms and diagnosis]
ECOG_Performance_Status: 1 [as directly stated in the examination findings]

Charlson_Comorbidity_Score: 2 [1 point for high blood pressure (hypertension), 1 point for glaucoma is not directly listed but can be considered under mild liver disease or other conditions without clear points assigned; however, given the direct options provided and typical scoring, we focus on clearly identifiable conditions like hypertension]
Karnofsky_Performance_Status: 90 [The performance status is explicitly mentioned as 90% in the text, indicating a high level of functioning]
ECOG_Performance_Status: 0 [Assuming ECOG 0 corresponds to a Karnofsky score of 90-100, indicating the patient is fully active and able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction]

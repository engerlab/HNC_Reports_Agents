Clinical_Assessments_Radiological_Lesions: CT scan of the head and neck region showed a left hypopharyngeal mass extending to the left paraglottic fat and abutting the left thyroid cartilage, no significant lymphadenopathies; flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy revealed an immobile left vocal cord and a mass involving the left piriform sinus

Charlson_Comorbidity_Score: 4 [2 points for coronary artery disease, 1 point for hypercholesterolemia, and 1 point for previous cancer (superficial bladder transitional cell carcinoma)]
Karnofsky_Performance_Status: 90 [Based on the statement "Performance status is evaluated at 90"]
ECOG_Performance_Status: 0 [Assuming a KPS of 90 corresponds to an ECOG of 0, as they are both measures of performance status]

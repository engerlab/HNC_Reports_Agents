Pathological_TNM: Not inferred
Clinical_TNM: T2 N2c MX
Primary_Tumor_Size: 2.6 cm
Tumor_Type_Differentiation: Poorly differentiated
Pathology_Details: Invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, p16 negative
Lymph_Node_Status_Presence_Absence: Present
Lymph_Node_Status_Number_of_Positve_Lymph_Nodes: 1 (left level II necrotic node)
Lymph_Node_Status_Extranodal_Extension: Present (extracapsular extension noted on CT Neck)
Resection_Margins: Not inferred
p16_Status: Negative
Immunohistochemical_profile: p16 negative
EBER_Status: Not inferred
Lymphovascular_Invasion_Status: Not inferred
Perineural_Invasion_Status: Not inferred
Smoking_History: Ex-smoker
Alcohol_Consumption: Non-Drinker
Pack_Years: 0.5 (assuming 'a couple of cigarettes a day' is approximately 2-3 cigarettes per day, and with a 10 year history, this would be roughly equivalent to 0.5 pack-years per year, given that 1 pack-year is 20 cigarettes per day for 1 year)
Patient_Symptoms_at_Presentation: Left neck mass, no dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia, choking with feeds, chest infections, or respiratory symptoms
Treatment_Recommendations: Primary chemoradiotherapy, external beam 67.5 Gy in 30 fractions
Follow_Up_Plans: Full body PET scan to rule out metastatic disease before initiating treatment
HPV_Status: Negative
Patient_History_Status_Prior_Conditions: Hypertension (HTN), Dyslipidemia (DLP), Hypothyroidism, Kidney Hematoma, Cataracts, Insomnia
Patient_History_Status_Previous_Treatments: Warfarin 5mg, Cromolyn 2% eye solution, atorvastatin 40mg, Ferrous sulfate, amlodipine 5mg, jentadueto, ASA 81 mg, pantaprazole 40mg, valsartan 160 mg, synthroid 75 mcg, docusate sodium
Clinical_Assessments_Radiological_Lesions: CT Neck showed 2.6 cm right BOT mass and 5cm necrotic left level 2a node, CT angiography of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed a new 1.7 cm nodule in the RLL which could potentially be metastatic
Clinical_Assessments_SUV_from_PET_scans: Not inferred
Charlson_Comorbidity_Score: 4 [Hypertension (1 point), Hypothyroidism (1 point), previous Kidney Hematoma could imply some renal disease but specifics are unclear so not counting additional points for it, and history of dyslipidemia also implies potential vascular issues but again without clear evidence of complications or severity, no additional points assigned]
Karnofsky_Performance_Status: 100 [Based on ECOG score of 0 which typically corresponds to a KPS score of 100 as the patient is fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction]
ECOG_Performance_Status: 0 [Patient has an ECOG score of 0 indicating no symptoms and full activity]

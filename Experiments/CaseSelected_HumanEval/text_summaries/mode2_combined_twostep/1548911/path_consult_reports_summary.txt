Charlson_Comorbidity_Score: 4 [1 point for COPD (chronic pulmonary disease), 1 point for hypercholesteremia (not directly listed but related to vascular disease), 2 points for cancer (testicular cancer is a previous condition, not currently active, but still counts)]
Karnofsky_Performance_Status: 90-100 [Performance Status: 0-1, which typically corresponds to a high Karnofsky score, as it indicates the patient is fully active and able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction]
ECOG_Performance_Status: 1 [Performance Status: 0-1, which typically corresponds to an ECOG score of 1, indicating the patient has mild symptoms but is generally able to perform daily activities]

**Treatment Plan**

* The patient will undergo concurrent chemoradiation therapy to the bilateral neck as the potential site of the primary cancer.

1259610.txt,consultation_notes,"Here is a summary of the report:

**Diagnosis:** Hypopharyngeal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) in an elderly gentleman.

**Medical History:** The patient has a history of rectal cancer, liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. He recently underwent surgery for rectal cancer and was found to have hypopharyngeal cancer during staging.

44651.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**

* 88-year-old woman with left alveolar cancer (cancer of the gum)

**Surgical Specimens**

* The patient underwent several surgical procedures, including:
	+ Partial maxillectomy (removal of part of the upper jaw)
	+ Lymph node dissection in the left neck
	+ Excision of a lymph node in the left neck

**Pathology Findings**

* The tumor was located in the upper gingiva/alveolus (gum and surrounding bone) and measured 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm.
* The tumor was a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates from the lining of the mouth.
* The tumor had invaded the surrounding bone and had extensive involvement around the tooth socket.
* The margins of the specimen were involved by invasive carcinoma, meaning that the cancer had spread to the edges of the tissue removed during surgery.
* No lymph-vascular invasion (spread of cancer through blood vessels or lymphatic vessels) was identified.
* No perineural invasion (spread of cancer along nerves) was identified.

**Lymph Node Evaluation**

* 31 lymph nodes were examined from the left neck dissection, and none of them showed evidence of cancer.
* A separate lymph node (node of Stahr) was also excised and found to be free of cancer.

**Pathologic Staging**

* The primary tumor was classified as pT2, meaning that it was more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* There was no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).
* Distant metastasis (spread of cancer to other parts of the body) was not applicable.

Overall, the patient has a locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the left alveolar ridge with involvement of the surrounding bone and margins. However, there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis or distant spread."
pathology_report_example.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**: A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery.

**Macroscopic Description**: The sample consists of 3 small tissue fragments (1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm) submitted for analysis.

**Diagnosis**: The biopsy from the right alveolar ridge reveals:

* Invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer), high-grade, located in the submucosa.
* No perineural invasion (cancer spread to nerves) was identified.
* Suspicious lymphovascular invasion (possible cancer spread through blood or lymph vessels).
* Negative results for p16 immunohistochemistry and EBV probe (EBER), which can help rule out certain types of cancer.

**Additional Findings**:

* The overlying squamous epithelium is not involved in the tumor.
* The tumor shows focal intercellular bridges, a characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma.
* Immunohistochemical tests revealed specific protein markers on the tumor cells (e.g., AE1/AE3+, CK5/6+, etc.), which can help identify the type of cancer.

The report is signed by a pathologist."
236853.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**: A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery.

**Biopsy Results**: The biopsy consists of 3 tissue fragments from the right alveolar ridge. The diagnosis is:

* **Invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma**, a type of cancer that is high-grade (aggressive) and located in the submucosa (a layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane).
* No perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves) was identified.
* Lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading to blood vessels or lymphatic vessels) is suspicious, but not confirmed.
* Additional tests:
	+ p16 immunohistochemistry: negative
	+ EBV probe (EBER): negative

**Tumor Characteristics**: The tumor has focal intercellular bridges and an immunohistochemical profile that is consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The overlying squamous epithelium is not involved.

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a high-grade, invasive cancer in his right alveolar ridge, which will require prompt surgical attention."
1244601.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the final pathology report:

The patient underwent two procedures: 

1. A biopsy of the left tonsil, which showed:
	* Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
	* P16 positive, which suggests that the cancer may be related to the human papillomavirus (HPV)
2. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a left neck mass and lymph node, which showed:
	* Only blood was obtained, with no abnormal cells or tissue present

The report describes the appearance of the tonsil biopsy sample as a fragile, beige-colored fragment, and the FNAB sample as a small amount of black sediment. Overall, the report confirms the presence of squamous cell carcinoma in the left tonsil, but does not find any cancer cells in the neck mass or lymph node."
129701.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the report:

A 51-year-old male patient had a mass in his right neck and tongue base, which was suspected to be carcinoma (cancer) or lymphoma. During surgery, a sample of tissue from the right tongue base was examined, and the initial diagnosis was invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The tissue sample was further examined, and the final diagnosis was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in the submucosa (a layer of tissue under the mucous membrane) of the right tongue base. Additionally, a test for p16 was performed at the request of the doctor, and the result was positive."
166906.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the report:

The final pathology report confirms that an 85-year-old man has invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) on his midline soft palate. The tumor thickness cannot be measured due to the fragmented nature of the biopsy specimen. Additional tests showed no signs of infection and negative results for p16 immunostaining. A second opinion from an internal consultant confirmed the diagnosis. The biopsy sample consisted of two small tissue fragments, which were examined in their entirety."

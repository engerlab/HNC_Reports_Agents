**Patient Information**

* 88-year-old woman with left alveolar cancer (cancer of the upper gum)

**Specimens Examined**

1. Multiple frozen sections (#1-6) from various sites in the mouth, including anterior lateral, anterior medial, medial palate, lateral cheek, posterior retromolar trigone, and deep margin.
2. Left superior alveolar mass (#7)
3. Left neck dissection, levels I, II, III (#8)
4. Left node of Stahr (#9)

**Results**

* Frozen sections (#1-6): Negative for neoplasia (cancer) at all margins
* Specimen #7 (Left superior alveolar mass):
	+ Tumor size: 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm
	+ Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma, well-differentiated
	+ Microscopic tumor extension: Extensive involvement around tooth socket with superficial bone invasion
	+ Margins: Involved by invasive carcinoma (both peripheral mucosal and deep margins)
* Specimen #8 (Left neck dissection):
	+ 31 lymph nodes examined, none involved by cancer
	+ Submandibular gland: No significant pathological alteration
* Specimen #9 (Left node of Stahr): Single lymph node examined, not involved by cancer

**Pathologic Staging**

* Primary tumor (pT): pT2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension)
* Regional lymph nodes (pN): pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)

Overall, the report suggests that the patient has a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the upper gum with extensive local involvement and superficial bone invasion. The cancer was found to involve both peripheral mucosal and deep margins, but no lymph node metastases were detected in the neck dissection specimens."
pathology_report_example.txt,pathology_reports,"Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:**
A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery in 10 days.

**Biopsy Results:**

* The biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.
* The tissue fragments showed invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa (the layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane).
* There was no evidence of perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves), but lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading to blood vessels or lymphatic vessels) was suspected.
* Additional tests, including p16 immunohistochemistry and EBV probe (EBER), were negative.

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* The tumor cells had a specific immunohistochemical profile, which can help identify the type of cancer.
* The overlaying squamous epithelium (the outer layer of tissue) was not involved in the cancer.
* The tumor showed focal intercellular bridges, which are characteristic of certain types of cancer.

**Conclusion:**
The patient has a high-grade, invasive non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in his right alveolar ridge, and further treatment (surgery) is planned."
236853.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:**
A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery.

**Biopsy Results:**

* The biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.
* The diagnosis is an invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa.
* There is no evidence of perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves), but lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading through blood or lymph vessels) is suspected.
* Additional tests were negative for certain markers, including p16 and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus).

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* The tumor has focal intercellular bridges and an immunohistochemical profile that suggests it is a squamous cell carcinoma.
* The overlaying squamous epithelium (the top layer of skin) is not involved.

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a high-grade, invasive cancer in his right alveolar ridge, which requires prompt surgical attention."
1244601.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Clinical History:** The patient had a biopsy of their left tonsil and a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a mass in their left neck.

**Diagnosis:**

* **Left Tonsil Biopsy:** Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) was found. The tumor tested positive for P16, which is a marker that can help identify the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers.
* **Left Neck FNAB:** Only blood was found in the sample, with no evidence of cancer cells.

**Macroscopic Description:**

* **Left Tonsil Biopsy:** The biopsy specimen consisted of a single fragile beige tissue fragment that measured 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm.
* **Left Neck FNAB:** The sample contained only a small amount of black sediment, which was submitted for examination.

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has squamous cell carcinoma in their left tonsil, but no cancer cells were found in the sample from their left neck mass."
129701.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the report:

A 51-year-old male patient presented with a mass in the right side of his neck and tongue base, approximately 3 cm in size. The initial impression was carcinoma (cancer) or possibly lymphoma. During surgery, a sample of tissue from the right tongue base was examined and found to be invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Further examination revealed that the cancer was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma located in the submucosa (a layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane). Additional testing was done at the request of the doctor, which showed that the tumor was positive for p16, a protein often associated with certain types of cancer. The final diagnosis is basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue base."
166906.txt,pathology_reports,"Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:** The patient is an 85-year-old man with an ulcer on the midline soft palate, suspected to be squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA).

**Diagnosis:** The biopsy of the midline soft palate shows:
* Invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
* The tumor thickness cannot be measured due to a fragmented specimen
* p16 immunostaining is negative (which may indicate that the cancer is not related to human papillomavirus)
* No organisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi) were found on special stains

**Specimen Description:** The biopsy consists of 2 small tissue fragments, which were submitted for examination in a single cassette.

Note: SCCA stands for Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates from squamous cells, the flat, thin cells that make up the outer layer of the skin and lining of some organs."

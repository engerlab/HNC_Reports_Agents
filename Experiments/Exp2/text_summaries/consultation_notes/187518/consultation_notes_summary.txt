Here is a summary of the report:

**Patient Information**

* A [AGE]-year-old woman from Chateauguay with a history of smoking (half a pack per day for 40 years) and occasional alcohol consumption.
* She has a past medical history of cholecystectomy, nasal bridge repair, right forearm fracture, arthritis, and disk problems.
* She is allergic to codeine and takes naproxen.

**Current Condition**

* The patient was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with an unknown primary site.
* She noticed a lump in her right neck three years ago, which was initially thought to be a fat lump. However, the lump increased in size over the past three months, leading to further investigation.
* A fine-needle aspirate (FNAC) revealed squamous cell carcinoma, and CT and PET scans showed a large lymph node at the right jugulodigastric area with high SUV uptake, indicating cancer.

**Physical Examination**

* The patient has a 5x4-cm mobile neck mass at the right jugulodigastric area, which is firm but not attached to the skin.
* There are no palpable masses on the contralateral neck, and the oropharynx examination revealed normal mucosa with no visible or palpable lesions.

**Treatment Plan**

* The patient will undergo concurrent chemoradiation therapy to the bilateral neck as the potential site of the primary cancer.
* She will receive 30 fractions of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy once a week.
* A consultation with a Head and Neck surgeon has been requested to arrange for panendoscopy to explore the primary site of the disease.
* The patient will also be seen by Medical Oncology, Psychology, Nutrition, and GI for further evaluation and management.

**Staging**

* The cancer is staged as Tx, N2b, indicating an unknown primary site with metastasis to the lymph nodes in the neck.

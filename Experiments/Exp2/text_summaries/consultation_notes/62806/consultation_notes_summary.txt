* Non-smoker and non-drinker.

**Current Condition:**

* Diagnosed with a left buccal mucosa minor salivary gland tumor, which was initially thought to be a pleomorphic adenoma but was later found to be a low-grade salivary gland adenocarcinoma with lymphovascular invasion.
* The tumor was removed surgically, but the pathology report suggests that it may not have been completely excised.

**Symptoms and Findings:**

* The patient noticed a painless mass in her left cheek over the past year, which has not changed in size.
* She has experienced a 20-pound weight loss of unknown etiology.
* Physical examination revealed a residual 1-cm mass on the upper aspect of the left buccal mucosa, which may be residual disease or surgical scarring.

**Recommended Course of Action:**

* A post-operative MRI to investigate any residual disease.
* Depending on the results of the MRI, the patient may undergo adjuvant external beam radiotherapy or surgical re-resection if feasible.

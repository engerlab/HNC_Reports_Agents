Here is a summary of the report:

**Diagnosis:** Hypopharyngeal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) in an elderly gentleman.

**Medical History:** The patient has a history of rectal cancer, liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. He recently underwent surgery for rectal cancer and was found to have hypopharyngeal cancer during staging.

**Symptoms:** The patient experiences mild difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and has a painless mass in his left neck. He also reports weight loss, mostly due to his recent surgery.

**Physical Examination:** The patient has multiple lymph nodes in his left neck and a small lymph node in the supraclavicular region. A flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy reveals thickening of the postcricoid space and left piriform sinus, with pooling of secretions.

**Staging:** The cancer is staged as T2, N2b, indicating a moderately sized tumor with multiple lymph nodes involved on one side of the neck.

**Treatment Plan:** The patient's case will be discussed at Tumor Board to consider treatment options. Concomitant chemoradiation is likely, and preparation for this treatment will begin. An MRI has been requested to complete staging and assess the extent of the tumor.

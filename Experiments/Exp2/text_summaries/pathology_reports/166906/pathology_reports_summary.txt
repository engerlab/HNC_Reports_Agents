Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:** The patient is an 85-year-old man with an ulcer on the midline soft palate, suspected to be squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA).

**Diagnosis:** The biopsy of the midline soft palate shows:
* Invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer)
* The tumor thickness cannot be measured due to a fragmented specimen
* p16 immunostaining is negative (which may indicate that the cancer is not related to human papillomavirus)
* No organisms (e.g. bacteria, fungi) were found on special stains

**Specimen Description:** The biopsy consists of 2 small tissue fragments, which were submitted for examination in a single cassette.

Note: SCCA stands for Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates from squamous cells, the flat, thin cells that make up the outer layer of the skin and lining of some organs.

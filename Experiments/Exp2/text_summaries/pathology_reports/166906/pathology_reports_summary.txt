Here is a summary of the report:

The final pathology report confirms that an 85-year-old man has invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) on his midline soft palate. The tumor thickness cannot be measured due to the fragmented nature of the biopsy specimen. Additional tests showed no signs of infection and negative results for p16 immunostaining. A second opinion from an internal consultant confirmed the diagnosis. The biopsy sample consisted of two small tissue fragments, which were examined in their entirety.

Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:**
A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery.

**Biopsy Results:**

* The biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.
* The diagnosis is an invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa.
* There is no evidence of perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves), but lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading through blood or lymph vessels) is suspected.
* Additional tests were negative for certain markers, including p16 and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus).

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* The tumor has focal intercellular bridges and an immunohistochemical profile that suggests it is a squamous cell carcinoma.
* The overlaying squamous epithelium (the top layer of skin) is not involved.

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a high-grade, invasive cancer in his right alveolar ridge, which requires prompt surgical attention.

Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**: A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery.

**Biopsy Results**: The biopsy consists of 3 tissue fragments from the right alveolar ridge. The diagnosis is:

* **Invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma**, a type of cancer that is high-grade (aggressive) and located in the submucosa (a layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane).
* No perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves) was identified.
* Lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading to blood vessels or lymphatic vessels) is suspicious, but not confirmed.
* Additional tests:
	+ p16 immunohistochemistry: negative
	+ EBV probe (EBER): negative

**Tumor Characteristics**: The tumor has focal intercellular bridges and an immunohistochemical profile that is consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The overlying squamous epithelium is not involved.

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has a high-grade, invasive cancer in his right alveolar ridge, which will require prompt surgical attention.

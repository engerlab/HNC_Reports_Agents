Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**: A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery.

**Macroscopic Description**: The sample consists of 3 small tissue fragments (1.0 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm) submitted for analysis.

**Diagnosis**: The biopsy from the right alveolar ridge reveals:

* Invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer), high-grade, located in the submucosa.
* No perineural invasion (cancer spread to nerves) was identified.
* Suspicious lymphovascular invasion (possible cancer spread through blood or lymph vessels).
* Negative results for p16 immunohistochemistry and EBV probe (EBER), which can help rule out certain types of cancer.

**Additional Findings**:

* The overlying squamous epithelium is not involved in the tumor.
* The tumor shows focal intercellular bridges, a characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma.
* Immunohistochemical tests revealed specific protein markers on the tumor cells (e.g., AE1/AE3+, CK5/6+, etc.), which can help identify the type of cancer.

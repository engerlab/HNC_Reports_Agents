Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information:**
A 74-year-old man with a tumor in his right maxillary sinus/nasal cavity, scheduled for surgery in 10 days.

**Biopsy Results:**

* The biopsy was taken from the right alveolar ridge.
* The tissue fragments showed invasive, non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) that is high-grade and located in the submucosa (the layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane).
* There was no evidence of perineural invasion (cancer spreading to nerves), but lymphovascular invasion (cancer spreading to blood vessels or lymphatic vessels) was suspected.
* Additional tests, including p16 immunohistochemistry and EBV probe (EBER), were negative.

**Tumor Characteristics:**

* The tumor cells had a specific immunohistochemical profile, which can help identify the type of cancer.
* The overlaying squamous epithelium (the outer layer of tissue) was not involved in the cancer.
* The tumor showed focal intercellular bridges, which are characteristic of certain types of cancer.

**Conclusion:**
The patient has a high-grade, invasive non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma in his right alveolar ridge, and further treatment (surgery) is planned.

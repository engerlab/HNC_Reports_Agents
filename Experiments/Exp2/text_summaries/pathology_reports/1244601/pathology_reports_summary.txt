Here is a summary of the pathology report:

**Clinical History:** The patient had a biopsy of their left tonsil and a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of a mass in their left neck.

**Diagnosis:**

* **Left Tonsil Biopsy:** Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) was found. The tumor tested positive for P16, which is a marker that can help identify the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers.
* **Left Neck FNAB:** Only blood was found in the sample, with no evidence of cancer cells.

**Macroscopic Description:**

* **Left Tonsil Biopsy:** The biopsy specimen consisted of a single fragile beige tissue fragment that measured 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm.
* **Left Neck FNAB:** The sample contained only a small amount of black sediment, which was submitted for examination.

Overall, the report indicates that the patient has squamous cell carcinoma in their left tonsil, but no cancer cells were found in the sample from their left neck mass.

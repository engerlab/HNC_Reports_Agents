Here's a summary of the report:

A 51-year-old male patient had a mass in his right neck and tongue base, which was suspected to be carcinoma (cancer) or lymphoma. During surgery, a sample of tissue from the right tongue base was examined, and the initial diagnosis was invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The tissue sample was further examined, and the final diagnosis was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma in the submucosa (a layer of tissue under the mucous membrane) of the right tongue base. Additionally, a test for p16 was performed at the request of the doctor, and the result was positive.

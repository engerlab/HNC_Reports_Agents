Here is a summary of the report:

A 51-year-old male patient presented with a mass in the right side of his neck and tongue base, approximately 3 cm in size. The initial impression was carcinoma (cancer) or possibly lymphoma. During surgery, a sample of tissue from the right tongue base was examined and found to be invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Further examination revealed that the cancer was basaloid squamous cell carcinoma located in the submucosa (a layer of tissue beneath the mucous membrane). Additional testing was done at the request of the doctor, which showed that the tumor was positive for p16, a protein often associated with certain types of cancer. The final diagnosis is basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the right tongue base.

Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**

* 88-year-old woman with left alveolar cancer (cancer of the upper gum)

**Specimens Examined**

1. Multiple frozen sections (#1-6) from various sites in the mouth, including anterior lateral, anterior medial, medial palate, lateral cheek, posterior retromolar trigone, and deep margin.
2. Left superior alveolar mass (#7)
3. Left neck dissection, levels I, II, III (#8)
4. Left node of Stahr (#9)

**Results**

* Frozen sections (#1-6): Negative for neoplasia (cancer) at all margins
* Specimen #7 (Left superior alveolar mass):
	+ Tumor size: 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm
	+ Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma, well-differentiated
	+ Microscopic tumor extension: Extensive involvement around tooth socket with superficial bone invasion
	+ Margins: Involved by invasive carcinoma (both peripheral mucosal and deep margins)
* Specimen #8 (Left neck dissection):
	+ 31 lymph nodes examined, none involved by cancer
	+ Submandibular gland: No significant pathological alteration
* Specimen #9 (Left node of Stahr): Single lymph node examined, not involved by cancer

**Pathologic Staging**

* Primary tumor (pT): pT2 (tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension)
* Regional lymph nodes (pN): pN0 (no regional lymph node metastasis)

Overall, the report suggests that the patient has a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the upper gum with extensive local involvement and superficial bone invasion. The cancer was found to involve both peripheral mucosal and deep margins, but no lymph node metastases were detected in the neck dissection specimens.

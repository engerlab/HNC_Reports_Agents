Here's a summary of the pathology report:

**Patient Information**

* 88-year-old woman with left alveolar cancer (cancer of the gum)

**Surgical Specimens**

* The patient underwent several surgical procedures, including:
	+ Partial maxillectomy (removal of part of the upper jaw)
	+ Lymph node dissection in the left neck
	+ Excision of a lymph node in the left neck

**Pathology Findings**

* The tumor was located in the upper gingiva/alveolus (gum and surrounding bone) and measured 2.8 x 1.9 x 0.7 cm.
* The tumor was a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that originates from the lining of the mouth.
* The tumor had invaded the surrounding bone and had extensive involvement around the tooth socket.
* The margins of the specimen were involved by invasive carcinoma, meaning that the cancer had spread to the edges of the tissue removed during surgery.
* No lymph-vascular invasion (spread of cancer through blood vessels or lymphatic vessels) was identified.
* No perineural invasion (spread of cancer along nerves) was identified.

**Lymph Node Evaluation**

* 31 lymph nodes were examined from the left neck dissection, and none of them showed evidence of cancer.
* A separate lymph node (node of Stahr) was also excised and found to be free of cancer.

**Pathologic Staging**

* The primary tumor was classified as pT2, meaning that it was more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension.
* There was no regional lymph node metastasis (pN0).
* Distant metastasis (spread of cancer to other parts of the body) was not applicable.

Overall, the patient has a locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the left alveolar ridge with involvement of the surrounding bone and margins. However, there is no evidence of lymph node metastasis or distant spread.

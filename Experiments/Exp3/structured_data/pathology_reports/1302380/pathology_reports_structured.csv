The specimens consist of fibrofatty tissue with identified lymph nodes, which are submitted for further examination. Some specimens have notes about the size of the lymph nodes and whether they are partially cystic. One specimen is labeled as a possible blood vessel (right internal jugular vein) and is serially cross-sectioned and submitted in one cassette. A frozen section is also mentioned, comparing parathyroid gland versus node."

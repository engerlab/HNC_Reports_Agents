DIAGNOSIS: PAROTID CA.
IDENTIFICATION: This is a [AGE] female.
REASON FOR REFERRAL: Consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is remarkable for left-sided breast cancer treated with lumpectomy
alone in [DATE]. The patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy. The patient is also known for hypothyroidism, anemia,
and hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS: Medications include Synthroid, ferrous sulfate, and a hyperlipidemia medication the name of which the
patient does not recall.
ALLERGIES: Nil.
FAMILY HISTORY: Nil.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a nondrinker and a nonsmoker. She lives alone in a seniors' home and is fully
autonomous.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient noted a mass at the angle of the mandible in [DATE]. This mass
was eventually biopsied in [DATE], fine-needle aspiration did demonstrate the presence of undifferentiated
carcinoma. The patient was taken to the operating room on [DATE], for a right parotid superficial lobe
excision. The pathology noted adenocarcinoma high grade with mixed mild epithelial and invasive glandular components
measuring 2 x 1.5 x 1.3 centimeters, no lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion was noted. However, the margins
were focally positive with tumor cells. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Presently, [PERSON]
states she feels quite well. She notes mild xerostomia. She denies any dysphagia or odynophagia. The remainder of the
review of systems is noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, this is a well-appearing lady in no acute distress. ECOG performance
status is 0. On head and neck examination, there is a well-healed surgical scar at the angle of the mandible on the right
side. There is no palpable adenopathy on neck and head examination. The examination of the oral cavity is
unremarkable. The patient was unable to lie supine for a physical examination. She states she experiences vertigo when
supine.
LABORATORIES/IMAGING: The patient did have a CT scan of the neck performed on [DATE], which did note
the known lesion with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen performed on [DATE], noted no evidence of metastatic disease.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a [AGE] lady with a diagnosis of high-grade adenocarcinoma of the
right parotid gland. The patient is status postsuperficial lobe excision with focally-positive margins. The rationale and
potential side effects of radiotherapy were described to the patient and after some discussion, the patient has elected to
proceed with treatment. As the patient is unable to lie supine due to vertigo, we positioned the patient with an incline of
approximately 30 degrees, and the patient was fine in this position. The patient will be CT simulated in this position with
the initiation of radiotherapy shortly thereafter.

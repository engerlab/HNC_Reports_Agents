* **Left Tonsil Biopsy:** Invasive, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (a type of cancer) was found. The tumor tested positive for P16, which is a marker that can help identify certain types of cancer.
* **Left Neck FNAB:** Unfortunately, only blood was obtained from the aspiration, and no diagnostic tissue or cells were found.

**Macroscopic Description:**

* **Tonsil Biopsy:** The biopsy sample consisted of a small, fragile piece of tissue (1.1 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm) that was sectioned and submitted for further examination.
* **Neck FNAB:** Only a small amount of black sediment (likely blood) was obtained from the aspiration.

In summary, the report confirms the presence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the left tonsil, but the FNAB of the neck mass did not yield any diagnostic tissue or cells.",was not inferred,was not inferred,was not inferred,was not inferred,was not inferred,was not inferred,was not inferred,was not inferred
